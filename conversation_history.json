The threshold voltage is 450 V.\n- This implies that there are at least two conditions under which this action should occur: detecting a voltage above the specified threshold, and the occurrence of any other relevant condition.\n\nFor Overcurrent Events:\n- Similarly, for overcurrent events, the subsystem must open main contactors when an overcurrent event is detected. The current threshold is 1950 A.\n- Again, there are conditions under which this action should occur: detecting a current above the specified threshold and possibly additional conditions.\n\nConsidering these requirements, we can deduce that at least two test case scenarios are necessary to cover both types of events:\n\n1. **Test Case Scenario for Overvoltage Event**:\n   - **Description:** The HV subsystem is tested under an overvoltage condition (i.e., the voltage reaches or exceeds 450 V).\n   - **Expected Result:** Upon detecting this event, the main contactors should open.\n   - **Preconditions:** Ensure that the system is in a state where it can detect and respond to overvoltage conditions. This might involve setting up the voltage monitoring circuitry correctly and ensuring all necessary safety features are enabled.\n\n2. **Test Case Scenario for Overcurrent Event**:\n   - **Description:** The HV subsystem is tested under an overcurrent condition (i.e., the current reaches or exceeds 1950 A).\n   - **Expected Result:** Upon detecting this event, the main contactors should open.\n   - **Preconditions:** Similar to the overvoltage scenario, ensure that the system can detect and respond to overcurrent conditions. This might involve setting up the current monitoring circuitry correctly and ensuring all necessary safety features are enabled.\n\nAdditionally, considering good testing practices, we would also want to cover scenarios where these events occur simultaneously or in combination with other system states (e.g., during startup, shutdown, or normal operation), but these specific requirements are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, a total of at least 4 test case scenarios could be envisioned based on the given information, focusing on overvoltage and overcurrent detection:\n\n- **Test Case 1:** Overvoltage event detected.\n- **Test Case 2:** Overcurrent event detected.\n- **Test Case 3:** Simultaneous occurrence of overvoltage and overcurrent events (if such a scenario is relevant).\n- **Test Case 4:** Normal operation with no adverse conditions, to ensure the system behaves correctly under baseline conditions.\n\nHowever, the actual number and specifics can vary based on further analysis or additional requirements that may not be outlined in the given context."

In this case, there are two primary conditions:\n\n1. Overvoltage event: If the voltage exceeds 450 V, the system should open the main contactors.\n2. Overcurrent event: If the current exceeds 1950 A, the system should also open the main contactors.\n\nGiven these two independent conditions, we can identify four possible scenarios where the system's response is triggered:\n\n**Scenario 1:** Overvoltage event detected (Voltage > 450 V)\n* Step 1: Monitor voltage levels\n* Step 2: Detect overvoltage condition (Voltage > 450 V)\n* Step 3: Send signal to control relay 1:0\n* Step 4: Open main contactors\n\n**Scenario 2:** Overcurrent event detected (Current > 1950 A)\n* Step 1: Monitor current levels\n* Step 2: Detect overcurrent condition (Current > 1950 A)\n* Step 3: Send signal to control relay 1:0\n* Step 4: Open main contactors\n\n**Scenario 3:** Simultaneous Overvoltage and Overcurrent events detected\n* Step 1: Monitor voltage and current levels simultaneously\n* Step 2: Detect both overvoltage (Voltage > 450 V) and overcurrent (Current > 1950 A)\n* Step 3: Send signal to control relay 1:0 for both conditions\n* Step 4: Open main contactors\n\n**Scenario 4:** No events detected, normal operation\n* Step 1: Monitor voltage and current levels\n* Step 2: Ensure no overvoltage (Voltage <= 450 V) or overcurrent (Current <= 1950 A)\n* Step 3: Continue normal system operation\n\nTo cover all these scenarios, at least four test case scenarios are necessary. These scenarios should focus on the system's response to various combinations of voltage and current levels.\n\nAs for whether this is a FUSI req (Functional Unit Safety Interface requirement), it depends on how the system interacts with other safety-critical systems in the larger context. However, based solely on the provided information, these test case scenarios appear to be related to the HV Prevention subsystem's functionality rather than a specific FUSI requirement."

Simulate an overvoltage event on the HV input.\n\t\t2. Verify that the main contactors open within a specified time (e.g., 10 ms).\n\t\t3. Verify that the control_relay signal is triggered (control_relay = 1:0).\n2. **Overcurrent Event Detection**\n\t* Test Case ID: TC_HV_002\n\t* Description: Simulate an overcurrent event (e.g., 2000 A) and verify that the main contactors open.\n\t* Precondition: The subsystem is in normal operation mode.\n\t* Steps:\n\t\t1. Simulate an overcurrent event on the HV input.\n\t\t2. Verify that the main contactors open within a specified time (e.g., 10 ms).\n\t\t3. Verify that the control_relay signal is triggered (control_relay = 1:0).\n3. **Normal Operation Mode**\n\t* Test Case ID: TC_HV_003\n\t* Description: Verify that the subsystem operates normally without triggering the main contactors.\n\t* Precondition: The subsystem is in normal operation mode.\n\t* Steps:\n\t\t1. Simulate a nominal voltage (e.g., 400 V) and current (e.g., 1000 A) on the HV input.\n\t\t2. Verify that the main contactors remain closed.\n\t\t3. Verify that the control_relay signal is not triggered (control_relay = 0:0).\n\n**Test Case Coverage Matrix:**\n\n| Test Case ID | Overvoltage Event Detection | Overcurrent Event Detection | Normal Operation Mode |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TC_HV_001 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| TC_HV_002 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| TC_HV_003 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\nThe test case coverage matrix indicates that these three test cases cover all possible scenarios for the system requirement.\n\n**Note:** These test cases are hypothetical and may need to be adapted based on the specific requirements of the subsystem. Additionally, this is not an exhaustive list of test cases, and further testing may be necessary to ensure the reliability and robustness of the system."
